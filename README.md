# STACK MACHINES
Some experiments with stack machines. 

### Tools 
There is supposed to be an Assembler, but for now its just a lexer that accepts the instructions in `asm/all_instr.asm`.

### Spec
Probably some sort of 16-bit Forth-style system like a WISC CPU/16. 

## Requirements 
- gcc/clang
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for tests.
